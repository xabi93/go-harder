# go-harder

This project is just for **fun**. The idea is create a go package to deal with the api, and maybe in the future create a command line app.

I have decompiled [my gym android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aimharderpro.mainapp&hl=es&gl=US) to build a cleaner CLI. The API is a bit messy, so don't expect the best code in this repo.
